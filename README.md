# Static Info Page using React

I never published any of my projects to GitHub and have
now realised that companies like to see how you made the application and not just the finished product.

So I will start from the very basics and move my way up.

Here is one of my first projects which is just a static react app that contains some facts about react.

I hope you enjoy :)

So how did I make this Static Page

1. Create React App and do a bit of spring cleaning
2. Take the content from our Figma Design and markup the html
3. Take our HTML Markup and create suitable Components
4. Start Styling - First I started with the Header and Footer
